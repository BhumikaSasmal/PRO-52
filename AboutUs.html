        <p>The Newtown School is the first IGBC Gold Certified Green School in India under the new school
             category. We took our first step towards this journey of excellence, on 16th April 2015.</p>
             <br><br>
        <p>The global technological landscape is evolving at a frenetic pace. Information
            travels at a speed hitherto unanticipated, even a decade ago. The Newtown
            School (NTS), located amidst one of the fastest economically developing regions of
            Eastern India, arrives at precisely this cusp of global transformation.</p>
            <br><br>
        <p>The school seeks to blend academics with practical knowledge in a unique
            ecosystem. This amalgamation will be synchronized with the values, which
            will transform each student into an asset for society.
            
            NTS has set a new benchmark in education through its approach towards the entire process of
            imparting education.</p>
            <br><br>
        <p>The curriculum at NTS has been designed to inculcate a multi-dimensional approach in problem solving 
            through teamwork and research. We at NTS believe that every student is unique in terms of creative talent, interests and inclination. Hence, our customised approach towards each student nurtures each child into a confident
            individual, capable of coping with the challenges of tomorrow.</p>
